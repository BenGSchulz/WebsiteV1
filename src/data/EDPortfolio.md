# Overview

This is a portfolio showing the projects I've completed in various Emergent Digital Practices classes. It is the first full web development project I completed. It is built with vanilla JS/HTML/CSS. Images of my EDP projects are organized under the tab for the class they were made for. I am happy with the look and design of the site, especially the fact that everything is displayed on a single page. This leads to the major weakness of the portfolio, though, making it so the tabbing navigation system is not flexible. If I wanted to add another class, it would require editing a lot of the code for current content as well. If I were to do this project over, using a library like react would really help to modularize the content and ease the addition of new content. I am taking this approach for my personal website, ensuring that minimal work is required to add new projects or sections to the site.
