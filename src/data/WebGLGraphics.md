# Overview

This is a small interactive graphics project that I built for an introductory graphics course. We used WebGL to make a scene that was affected by user input. We wrote our own shaders with GLSL for texturing and lighting as well. There is a lot of room for improvement in this project, for instance adding interactive lighting or a moving camera. I am happy with the end product, though, and I enjoyed learning about the history and evolution of computer graphics, it is certainly a deep and complex field of development. I came away with from the course with a great appreciation for the foundation that drives the visual aspect games that I love so much. It also made me grateful for people who write higher level libraries like three.js that make bringing 3D graphics to the web a bit more streamlined.
