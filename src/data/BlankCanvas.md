# Overview

Take up your paintbrush in this stealth platformer as you traverse a bleak world, leaving behind your own splash of color.

Play as a starving artist whose creativity has been suppressed by a tyrannical regime. Gather your courage and venture out at night, sneaking across the rooftops of your city to express yourself and paint a mural on a government building.

Paint the world freely using your paintbrush, use special paints to solve puzzles and give yourself superhuman abilities, and sneak by the goons patrolling the streets around you.

Blank Canvas is the game created for my capstone game development course. I worked on this game with two other programmers using Unreal Engine 4.  

# Development

The development process went through three phases, each about 2.5 months long. Our first phase was largely conceptual and culminated in a game pitch with a small prototype demo. Throughout this phase, we all devised multiple smaller pitches that were focused on simple premises or ideas for mechanics. These were critiqued and narrowed down until we found one we were all excited to pursue further. We chose UE4 as the engine because we felt that the quick turn around on prototyping with blueprints would help us to iterate on mechanics quickly and smoothly and give us some more time to focus on art and design, which we were all not as comfortable with. I believe we are all happy with the choice and we enjoyed other features of the engine as well, like the animation, sound, and AI systems.The pitch we ended with was quite different from our final product, though, being a combat focused beat-em-up as opposed to the stealth-flavored puzzle game we ended with. 

Phase 2 brought the game from a prototype to an alpha build. The goal was to implement the list of features that we included in our pitch. We started off by editing this list pretty heavily as we decided we didn't really like the direction we were going with beat-em-up. We felt it didn't emphasize the unique painting aspect of our game. After deciding a new feature goal list, we started the development. We worked in sprints, deciding on tasks in weekly standups. We organized tasks using GitHub projects and we also used GitHub as our source control. I worked largely on the AI and some miscellaneous features like checkpoints and distraction paint mechanics. We also had weekly playtests with pro developers in the rear of this phase that were very valuable in rooting out bugs and tuning gameplay. 

Through phase 3 we went to work juicing the game up. We filled our greyboxed levels with assets from the UE store and added sounds and more story beats. This phase was also full of gameplay tweaks as we continued playtesting. We showed the game at a small gaming expo hosted by DU (DU Arcade) and also got a lot of valuable feedback from the audience there. It was a great experience to have so many people play our game and have them enjoy it. The end of the school year signaled the end of development and we came away with a beta-version we are proud of. 

# Post-Mortem

The strongest aspect of our game is the painting mechanic, it allows for some fun puzzle design and it is easily expandable to add new paint behaviors. I think we could have benefitted from moving away from or reworking the stealth aspects. Oftentimes the paint and stealth mechanics were in conflict as the former promotes movement and experimentation while the latter punishes that behavior. A potential rework could see the AI changed from patrols to sensors that add another, more well-defined, puzzle mechanic. Ultimately, finding a better balance between the painting and enemies would be beneficial. 

I learned so much about development throughout the making of this game. I loved learning UE4's behavior trees and found a new appreciation for game AI. I continued to grow my knowledge of UE4's other features too and am confident now in my skills to bring ideas to life in the engine. It was great to collaborate with a team and I gained a lot of insight into how planning for a team is different than for solo projects. The constant feedback from both team members and our playtesters was instrumental in reaching an end product we take pride in.
