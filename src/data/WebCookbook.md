# Overview

This is the first full-stack application I built. It uses the MEAN stack with bootstrap and UI bootstrap (generated with the [Angular Full-Stack Generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) version 4.2.2). I am quite happy with the back-end functionality of the app. You can perform CRUD operations on Users, Recipes, and Reviews ([Documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenGSchulz/WebCookbook/master/documentation/project01Doc.txt)). The front-end is plain but responsive and uses some nice components provided by UI Bootstrap. If I were to continue work on the project, I would spruce up the interface with some custom styling and color themes. I would also add authorization for users and add restrictions to certain actions like reviewing and deleting. Another nice feature to add would be a way for users to save and search for specific recipes.
