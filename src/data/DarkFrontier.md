# Overview

Dark Frontier is a top-down horror western shoot-em-up. Kill enemies with your trusty revolver before they can get to you. Watch your ammo, though! 

This was my first full game project using Unity. I started with an overly ambitious design document with a set of features that very quickly started slipping. I am happy with the overall look and feel of the game. I managed to piece together free game art/sounds and made my own UI that fit the aethetic I was going for. The gameplay is the weak point, having only one working mechanic and unintelligent AI. I learned a very valuable lesson about design scoping through this project and it's helped me to set more realistic goals in other projects.
